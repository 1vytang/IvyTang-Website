# Ivy Tang Personal Website

Hi, I’m Ivy, a cybersecurity student with interests in threat detection, systems security, and risk assessment. I have developed a strong cybersecurity mindset through my technical work, but also throughout my life. Whether it was playing defense in soccer, chess games, or arguing with my sister, I have learned to combine my academic training with real-world analytical thinking to bring a curious, strategic, and creative approach to cybersecurity.

This repo features my personal website with professional, academic, and personal details coded using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and was deployed using Vercel.
